ANOVA with R

i) do boxplot by algorithm type

ii) statistics -> means -> One-way ANOVA
    [x] Pairwise comparison of means
    [x] Welch F-test not assuming equal variance
        From numerical summary by group (more than twice sd implies population variances are not equal -> check box

    ->go back to analysis of variance able Pr(>F) is the most important (if the means are equal, what's the chance the data gives us results we got).
